  description: 'The Twilio SendGrid Statistics API allows you to retrieve the various
    statistics related to your email program.


    Tracking your emails is an important part of being a good sender and learning
    about how your users interact with your email. This includes everything from clicks
    and opens to looking at which browsers and mailbox providers your customers use.


    SendGrid has broken up statistics in specific ways so that you can get at-a-glance
    data, as well as the details of how your email is being used.


    Category statistics are available for the previous thirteen months only.


    See [**Statistics Overview**](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/analytics-and-reporting/stats-overview)
    for more information.'

      description: '**This endpoint allows you to retrieve your email statistics segmented
        by country and state/province.**


        **We only store up to 7 days of email activity in our database.** By default,
        500 items will be returned per request via the Advanced Stats API endpoints.


        Advanced Stats provide a more in-depth view of your email statistics and the
        actions taken by your recipients. You can segment these statistics by geographic
        location, device type, client type, browser, and mailbox provider. For more
        information about statistics, please see our [User Guide](https://wwww.twilio.com/docs/sendgrid/ui/analytics-and-reporting/stats-overview).'

        **We only store up to 7 days of email activity in our database.** By default,
        500 items will be returned per request via the Advanced Stats API endpoints.


        Advanced Stats provide a more in-depth view of your email statistics and the
        actions taken by your recipients. You can segment these statistics by geographic
        location, device type, client type, browser, and mailbox provider. For more
        information about statistics, please see our [Statistics Overview](https://sendgrid.com/docs/ui/analytics-and-reporting/stats-overview/).'

      description: The number of items in the list to skip over before starting to
        retrieve the items for the requested page. The default `offset` of `0` represents
        the beginning of the list, i.e. the start of the first page. To request the
        second page of the list, set the `offset` to the page size as determined by
        `limit`. Use multiples of the page size as your `offset` to request further
        consecutive pages. E.g. assume your page size is set to `10`. An `offset`
        of `10` requests the second page, an `offset` of `20` requests the third page
        and so on, provided there are sufficiently many items in your list.
